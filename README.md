# Unit 6 Project: Build a Frontend App!

## Directions
Congratulations! You've made it to another milestone! You've worked hard to develop an understanding of HTTP, Promises, `fetch API`, `async/await`, and now your grasp of Asynchronous JavaScript is sound enough for you to build another really cool project!

Your assignment is to build a frontend application. Again, there are general guidelines and checkpoints for this project, but it is left open-ended so that you can really express your creativity. The purpose of this project is for you to:
  1. Build upon your JavaScript foundations to create a more complex and in-depth project.
  2. Explore external APIs from some of your favorite applications.
  3. Consume and build upon interesting free APIs.
  4. Become acclimated with a GitHub workflow that is reflective of the processes used to collaborate on production software in the real-world.
  4. Have fun and build something that you feel proud to show off!

## Project Requirements
The requirements of this project are straightforward. You must build a frontend application that fetches data from some external API and presents some novel view or insights based on that data. I encourage you to choose a problem, data set, or API that you are personally interested in. 

In addition, **we want every student to be responsible for owning at least one fetch feature**. Afterall, it wouldn't be a fair project week unless everyone got to practice Asynchronous JavaScript! Therefore, your group must have _at least_ 1 unique fetch URL per member of the group, but you can have more! These different fetch calls can be to different URL endpoints within the same API, or they can be to different APIs.  

Your task is to define a problem that your app will solve but, to some degree, you will be limited by which data sets and APIs you can get your hands on. There are a number of applications that expose APIs for developers to build cool apps on top of. Here are a few resources to start your search:
  1. [API List](https://apilist.fun/)
  2. [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis)
  3. [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

There is so much more out there too!

## Vetting your API 

Not all APIs are created equal. Before you commit to using an API and planning your project, you should make fetch calls either via the POSTMAN or by using JavaScript's `fetch`. Once you confirm you are able to access the data, you can use to the API for your project. 

## Using Your Resources

Just like last time, this project will push you to lean into your _autodidacticism_. In order to complete this project at a satisfactory level, you _will_ have to do some self-learning. This is by design. By pulling from blog articles, YouTube tutorials, and examples on GitHub, you will be able to build whatever you put your mind to.


#### User Interface/Experience:
* Is your app visually appealing? Does it use a CSS Library?
* Can it be used intuitively with minimal direction?
* Does your app respond predictably to user inputs ,and does it handle errors well?
* Is the fronteend bug free?

#### Code Quality:
* Is your business logic well-encapsulated?
* Are your variables and functions well-named?
* Is your code well commented?
