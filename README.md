# Unit 6 Project: Build a Frontend App!

## Directions
Congratulations! You've made it to another milestone! You've worked hard to develop an understanding of HTTP, Promises, XHR, and the Fetch API and now your grasp of AJAX is sound enough for you to build another really cool project!

Your assignment is to build a frontend application. Again, there are general guidelines and checkpoints for this project, but it is left open-ended so that you can really express your creativity. The purpose of this project is for you to:
  1. Build upon your JavaScript foundations to create a more complex and in-depth project.
  2. Explore external APIs from some of your favorite applications.
  3. Consume and build upon interesting open-source data sets.
  4. Become acclimated with a GitHub workflow that is reflective of the processes used to collaborate on production software in the real-world.
  4. Have fun and build something that you feel proud to show off!

## Project Requirements
The requirements of this project are straightforward. You must build a frontend application that fetches data from some external API and presents some novel view or insights based on that data. I encourage you to choose a problem, data set, or API that you are personally interested in. For this project, you are not limited to the web browser as your only UI option. You are allowed to experiment with Slack bots, Alexa skills, Google Assistant Apps, or any other platform that you may be interested in.

Your task is to define a problem that your app will solve but, to some degree, you will be limited by which data sets and APIs you can get your hands on. There are a number of applications that expose APIs for developers to build cool apps on top of. Here are a few resources to start your search:
  1. [API List](https://apilist.fun/)
  2. [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis)
  3. [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

There is so much more out there too!

## Vetting your API 

Not all APIs are created equal. Before you commit to using an APi and pitching your project, you should make fetch calls either via the browser, POSTMAN, or using `fetch` in the console. Once you confirm you are able to access the data, you can use to the API for your project. 

## Using Your Resources

Just like last time, this project will push you to lean into your _autodidacticism_. In order to complete this project at a satisfactory level, you _will_ have to do some self-learning. This is by design. By pulling from blog articles, YouTube tutorials, and examples on GitHub, you will be able to build whatever you put your mind to.

## Grading
### Scoring
Your submission will be scored against the following criteria:

#### Novel Insights:
* Does your app provide novel insight on data fetched from an API and/or does it present this data in a novel way?

#### User Interface/Experience:
* Is your app visually appealing?
* Can it be used intuitively with minimal direction?
* Is the frontend bug free?

#### Code Quality:
* Is your business logic well-encapsulated?
* Are your variables and functions well-named?
* Is your code well commented?
